## Configuration

For local development, create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following environment variables.

| Variable   | Description                                                                                                                     | Example                 |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `SITE`     | The hostname from which you'll run your project, e.g. `http://localhost:4321` for local development.                            | `http://localhost:4321` |
| `BASE_URL` | The base path to be appended to the hostname, which can be useful when deployed to certain hosting providers like GitHub Pages. | `/popletts/`            |

For deployment, make sure these variables are available during the build process.
